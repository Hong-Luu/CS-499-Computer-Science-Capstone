# CS 340 Project: Grazioso Salvare Dashboard

## Overview
Following the successful planning phase and client approval from Grazioso Salvare, we are excited to proceed with the development of an interactive dashboard for the Austin Animal Center Outcomes dataset. Initially conceived to aid in the identification and categorization of rescue dogs suitable for training, this dashboard aims to optimize Grazioso Salvare's selection process through user-friendly data interaction and visualization.

The goal is to deliver a dashboard that not only meets the specific requirements of Grazioso Salvare but also enhances user engagement through a creative and intuitive layout. The design focuses on ease of use, aesthetic appeal, and effective integration of interactive elements, including data filters and visual analytics.

## Project Goals
The primary aim of this project is to develop a dashboard that supports:
- Effective management and visualization of animal data.
- Real-time interactive data queries.
- Simplified user interactions to facilitate rapid identification of suitable rescue dogs.

## Users and Assumptions
- **Grazioso Salvare Staff**: Needs efficient tools to filter and visualize data according to specific rescue criteria.
- **Animal Rescue Researchers**: Requires access to detailed, interactive data sets to enhance decision-making in rescue operations.

## Key Features
- **Interactive Filters**: Enable users to dynamically query the dataset based on specific rescue criteria (Water Rescue, Mountain/Wilderness Rescue, Disaster/Individual Tracking).
- **Data Visualization**: Incorporate geolocation charts and pie charts to visualize data effectively, providing insights at a glance.
- **User Authentication**: Ensure secure access to the dashboard, maintaining data integrity and user privacy.

## Screens and Navigation
- **Login/Register Screen**: Secure access for authenticated users.
- **Dashboard Main View**: Interactive filters and visual representation of data.
- **Detailed Data Views**: In-depth information available through drill-down capabilities in charts and tables.

## Technical Implementation
- **Frontend**: Developed using Dash by Plotly, ensuring high responsiveness and interactivity.
- **Backend**: Utilizes Python for backend processes with Pandas for data manipulation and MongoDB for data storage, ensuring efficient data handling.

## Enhancements and Reflections
### Enhancements
- **Improved Data Interaction**: Enhanced filtering options allow for more precise data querying and manipulation.
- **Advanced Visualization Techniques**: Utilized advanced charting libraries to provide clearer and more actionable insights.

### Reflections
- **Challenges**: Addressed challenges in data integration and real-time responsiveness of the dashboard.
- **Learning Outcomes**: Gained deeper insights into full-stack development and the specific needs of data-driven decision-making in animal rescue.
