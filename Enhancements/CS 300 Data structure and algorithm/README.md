# CS 300 - Academic Advising Application

## Overview
This command-line application is the result of a collaborative effort between the Computer Science department at ABCU and its students to enhance academic advising. Approved by the academic advisors, the application now enters the coding phase, set to transform how advisors interact with course data and student advising processes.

Our objective is to deliver an application that meets the operational needs of academic advisors while enhancing user engagement through a user-friendly command-line interface. The application is designed to streamline the advising process by providing instant access to course details, including prerequisites, thereby enabling advisors to assist students more effectively in their academic planning.

## Project Goals
The primary aim of this project is to:
- Provide easy access to detailed course information.
- Improve the efficiency of academic advising at ABCU.
- Support advisors with tools to better understand and manage course data.

## Users and Assumptions
- **Academic Advisors**: Require quick access to course information, tools for managing course data, and capabilities to efficiently guide students.
- **Department Administrators**: Need robust tools for overseeing course offerings and prerequisites.

## Key Features
- **Load Data Structure**: Prompt user to load course data from a file into a structured format for easy retrieval.
- **Print Course List**: Display an organized list of all courses in the Computer Science department, sorted alphanumerically.
- **Print Course Information**: Provide detailed information about a specific course when requested, including its title and prerequisites.
- **Exit**: Safe exit from the application.

## Screens and Navigation
- **Command-Line Interface**:
  - **Load Data Structure**: Users start by loading the course data.
  - **Print Course List**: Allows viewing of the complete course list.
  - **Print Course Information**: Users can query specific courses to see detailed information.
  - **Exit**: Terminates the application.

## Technical Implementation
- **Frontend**: Developed using command-line interfaces to ensure compatibility across different systems.
- **Backend**: Utilizes advanced data structures to store and retrieve course data efficiently.

## Enhancements and Reflections
### Enhancements
- **Improved Data Loading**: Optimized the data loading process for better performance.
- **Enhanced Course Listing**: Alphanumeric sorting provides a more intuitive way for advisors to find courses.

### Reflections
- **Challenges**: Faced challenges in designing an interface that was both intuitive and capable of handling complex queries.
- **Learning Outcomes**: Gained deeper insights into efficient data structure implementation and user experience design in a command-line environment.
