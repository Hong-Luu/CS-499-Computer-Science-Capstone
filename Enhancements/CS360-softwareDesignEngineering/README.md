# CS 360 Android Mobile Application - Inventory App
## Overview
Following the successful approval of our app development proposal by Mobile2App and our esteemed client, we are excited to transition into the next phase of development for the Inventory App. This application, originally conceived to optimize warehouse management processes, will now undergo UI development to ensure that the interface is as intuitive and effective as the functionality it supports.

Our goal is to deliver a UI design that not only meets the specific operational needs of warehouse managers and staff but also enhances user engagement through a creative and user-friendly layout. The design will focus on ease of use, aesthetic appeal, and the harmonious integration of strong features, including real-time inventory updates and comprehensive user management tools.

This document outlines the envisioned UI design for the Inventory App, detailing the layout, navigation paths, and key features. Our approach aims to create a cohesive and visually appealing experience that supports efficient warehouse management and provides a superior user experience.
